// Generate a shopping list from recipeâ€™s ingredients

// When a shopping list is generated:
// A shopping list generated locally in an object
// - if user is signed in, they can save the shopping list (list is created in the database and associated with a pantry)

// Shopping list generation:
// Pull ingredients from recipe -> recipeIngredients
// Create an empty shopping list -> shoppingList
// If the user is signed in
// pull ingredients from a pantry -> pantryIngredients
// Iterate through recipeIngredients
// If recipeIngredient is in pantryIngredients, add recipeIngredient to shoppingList
// If user is not signed in, all recipeIngredients are added to shoppingList
